Going into this semester, I understood HTML, CSS and JavaScript to a basic level. I was able to create a static site that looked bearable. Alongside web 2, this project has help me learn PHP, and understand the fundamentals of a PHP framework, which in our case was Laravel. 
<br/><br/><b><u>Laravel Framework</u></b><br/>
Laravel, when we first encountered it, was a scary and daunting task. It seemed to be very different both in structure and complexity to anything we had ever used before. This made every sprint onwards from when we were introduced to Laravel, challenging in terms of both the issue itself and the implementation. I am proud of where I am now and how far I have come. The third sprint we were all assigned to the same one issue. This was to help us learn and understand the Laravel framework. In the beginning, Michael and Nick showed that they could adapt and learn faster than I could, as a result they took charge. I took a more backseat-programmer approach as I tried to watch them and understand that way. I was of a bit of help a few times as I was able to identify similar patterns to other languages that allowed me to follow the logic. This allowed me to continue learning the framework so that by the end of the semester, I was comfortable in using the framework and was capable of utilising the features. I was able to achieve this mostly on my own but if I was stuck, I would ask for help clarifying and the rest of the group was good at helping. 
<br/><br/><b><u>JavaScript to PHP</u></b><br/>
For sprint four, I had to port over the home page from our static site to the Laravel framework and convert our pre-existing JavaScript. This was a significant step for the team as this allowed us to retrieve the dates from the database and generate them on the fly rather than hard coding dates into a table which is what we had in our static site. Although this doesn’t seem like a big achievement, it allowed similar logic to be used in our assignments and semester’s page which were our standout and more technically challenging pages. This was a good example of me implementing a design feature or skeleton that furthers the project.

<br/><br/><b><u>Git</u></b><br/>
One thing I have learnt in this paper is how to properly manage source control using Git. Git was the main tool the team and myself used as version control. I had used Git Lab in other papers to show the development process. I used it by only committing changes if I needed to access them on campus or if I had fully finished a large feature. I learnt through this paper that using the integrated Git menu in Visual Studio Code or using Git bash and committing as often as I can is the best workflow as it can be used to roll back changes or better show my progress. I deleted a local version without committing changes so I could roll back. I learnt that I should have used git reset –hard to rollback any changes and restore the branch to the last stable version. Michael and I found this out and immediately shared this with the group. This project has allowed me to have a better understanding of how Git works and the various commands I can employ to better harness the power Git has. I found that using the interactive command tool also helped me better understand what effect the commands I use have. <a href="http://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html">Here</a>

<br/><br/><b><u>JavaScript auto filling tables</u></b><br/>
For sprint four, I was tasked with porting over the homepage from our static site to Laravel. Initially we were going to keep the Javascript and have our date tables being auto-filled by a JavaScript function as it was a request from the client that they not be hard-coded. I had initially thought this was going to be easy but I eventually realised that it wasn't as straight foward as I thought. I am super proud of this code as it took a lot of effort and I even had to get help from other teammates. This code was challenging to me and showed how much dedication I had to getting the job done.
<br/><br/><b><u>SSH Keys and Git</u></b><br/>
During the final few sprints, we were introduced to SSH keys and the integration of Git. Many of the teams were having issues where we would have to put our Git username and passwords in every time we wanted to commit a change, push or pull. This became very frustrating especially at polytech where the computers are setup for the Gitlab credentials of the user. SSH keys were introduced to save they day and save us time. It sped up the process ten fold because of not having to enter any credentials. During sprint five was when we were told this and to my dismay at the end of the sprint, I had accidentaly set my key up with read only access, meaning my commits weren't being written to my branch on Git. After discovering this, I quickly unlinked the SSH key from the project and added one to my own profile making sure it had both read and write permissions. After this hiccup I was able to use the keys to my advantage and learnt about the different access levels. I now know to always check what permissions you have when setting up anything that has permisson levels. 
<br/><br/><b><u>Final Thoughts</u></b><br/>
This semester I have learnt that I can’t leave things to the last minute and that my knowledge wave I was riding through first year has well and truly run out. I have learnt that I need to take the time to learn new ideas, technologies and implementations. My progress through this project has shown that as during the first couple of sprints I was doing the bare minimum, but as I have progressed so  has the amount I’ve had to do. This was true up until the last sprint as the group ran out issues or features and I was given extra time to complete my previous sprint
